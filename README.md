# Python - GDP-per-Capita
In this project I will go through the GDP per Capita of countries, creating data visualisations and conducting Exploratory Data Analysis, including:
  - IMF world estimates and Worldbank estimates
  - Data cleaning and validation
  - Creating a selection of data visualisations using correlation heatmaps, scatter plots and histograms
